# NN Classification with Simulated Sonar Data

Offline simulations were done in MATLAB and COMSOL and their results are in the mat files. For details on the simulation of the data, see Engquist, B., Frederick, C., Huynh, Q., & Zhou, H. 2017. "Seafloor identification in sonar imagery via simulations of Helmholtz equations and discrete optimization." Journal of Computational Physics, 338, 477-492.

# List of files
.m files: seafloorClassification.m selectData.m

Datasets: oneLayerSeabed_N=400.mat twoLayerSeabed_N=8000.mat

folders: COMSOL and htm

# To use

Run seafloorClassification.m in MATLAB, ensuring that the datasets are in the correct directory
